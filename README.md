# MLHackRisk

This project is aimed at reducing the effort of testing which forms a huge part of any software development life cycle.We are trying to look into this problem
from a developers as well as testers perspective and on a high level we are focussing on two problem statements.

The first part is to help users qucikly resolve defects by being able to predict defect and suitable resolution using models trained from past data.
The second part is focussed to help testers fcous on hotspot modules which contributes to most of the defects and perform more testing for those modules during
regression.
